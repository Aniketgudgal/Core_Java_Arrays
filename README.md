# Core Java – Arrays

A small collection of Core Java array practice problems and example solutions. This repo contains beginner-friendly implementations grouped by approach (two-pointers, brute-force, 2D array exercises, sliding window, etc.).

## What you'll find

- Practice problems implemented in plain Java (.java files).
- Example categories:
	- Two pointers
	- Brute-force approaches
	- Sliding window
	- 2D array exercises (matrix addition, transpose, multiplication)

## Repository structure (important folders)

- `Arrays/` — core array examples and exercises
	- `2D_Array/` — matrix and 2D-array problems
	- `Brute_Force_Approach/` — straightforward solutions
	- `Sliding_Window/` — sliding-window examples
	- `Two pointers/` — two-pointer technique problems

Examples include: `SortArray.java`, `RotateArray.java`, `PrimeArray.java`, `MaxSumSubarray.java`, `MatrixMultiplication.java`, and more.

## Quick: compile & run a file

Open a terminal (PowerShell) in the repository root or the specific folder and run:

```powershell
# compile
javac Arrays\SortArray.java

# run (use the class name without .java)
java Arrays.SortArray
```

If a file is inside a package or the `package` statement is used, adjust the commands accordingly or compile from the project root respecting the package path.
